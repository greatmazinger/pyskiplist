pyskiplist
==========

A Python implementation of the skiplist data structure.

This is a work in progress for me so suggestions are welcome.
In no particular order these are on my To Do list:
- unit tests
- how to package in a Pythonic way

Furthermore, I would be interested in testing the data structure
in applications that need a balanced binary tree.
